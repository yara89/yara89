# Hi, I'm Yara

Hello, Yara here, check out my profile.
<br/> 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/yara-abbas/ 

✏️ I’m currently learning to Develop some web apps using Python Flask, and more....
I have completed 3 cycles of <strong>Frontend Web Development</strong> with <a href="https://www.frauenloop.org/"> FrauenLoop</a> in Berlin, and I am currently in my 4th Cycle. I am very lucky to be involved in the FraueLoop initiative here in Berlin, as a program that tries improve diversity and inclusion in the Tech Field.
